Hello, my name is SUN QIGAN
I am a passionate novice developer when it comes to technology. I'm often referred to as a "newbie," but I have a deep love for programming, open-source projects, and the pursuit of new technologies. I frequently work with the following programming languages:

- Python
- C++

My hobbies include sports, fitness, and video games. Occasionally, I enjoy exploring the unique beauty of life on my own. I'm also enthusiastic about contributing to the open-source community.


Feel free to reach out to me, and let's explore technology and collaborate on projects together.
def move(n, a, buffer, c):
    if(n == 1):
        print(a,"->",c)
        return
    move(n-1, a, c, buffer)
    move(1, a, buffer, c)
    move(n-1, buffer, a, c)
move(3, "a", "b", "c")

// The first is to define a moving function, four parameters represent, respectively, the number of plates on a column a, buffer is b column, named buffer is easy to understand, as the name implies is a move to c buffer.Then c is the target post.
