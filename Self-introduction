Hello, my name is SUN QIGAN
I am a passionate novice developer when it comes to technology. I'm often referred to as a "newbie," but I have a deep love for programming, open-source projects, and the pursuit of new technologies. I frequently work with the following programming languages:

- Python
- C++

My hobbies include sports, fitness, and video games. Occasionally, I enjoy exploring the unique beauty of life on my own. I'm also enthusiastic about contributing to the open-source community.


Feel free to reach out to me, and let's explore technology and collaborate on projects together.
